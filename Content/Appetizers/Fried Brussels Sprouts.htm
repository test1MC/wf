        <p>1 clove <MadCap:keyword term="garlic" />garlic, minced</p>
        <p>1 <MadCap:keyword term="Serrano chile" />Serrano chile, seeded and minced</p>
        <p>¼ cup <MadCap:keyword term="red wine vinegar" />red wine vinegar</p>
        <p>1 tbsp <MadCap:keyword term="honey" />honey</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Scallions" />Scallions, white and green parts, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>Handful of <MadCap:keyword term="walnut" />walnut pieces, toasted and coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>½ cup extra-virgin <MadCap:keyword term="olive oil" />olive oil</p>
        <p>1 pound <MadCap:keyword term="brussels sprouts" />brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered lengthwise</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Parsley" />Parsley leaves</p>
        <p>2 tbsp salt-packed <MadCap:keyword term="capers" />capers, rinsed and patted dry</p>
        <p>Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Balsamic vinegar" />Balsamic vinegar</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>Pour enough oil into a medium pot so that the oil comes 3 inches up the sides.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>While the oil is heating, whisk together the garlic, serrano, red wine vinegar, honey, scallions, walnuts and extra-virgin olive oil in a bowl large enough to toss all of the brussels sprouts. Keep the bowl near the stovetop.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Working in batches, deep-fry the brussels sprouts until the edges begin to curl and brown. To the last batch, add the parsley and capers. Give the contents of the pot a stir. When the color of the parsley becomes a deeper, more saturated shade of green. Remove the contents of the pot with a skimmer and place directly in the bowl of dressing. Toss to coat. Add salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle the balsamic vinegar and toss all together at the end.</p>

        <p> The original recipe called for Anchovies, but we have left them out. Maybe hit this with a little Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce to add a little salt.</p>
