Gather the dough into a stiff ball.  Knead the dough on a clean flat surface for about 10 minutes or until smooth.  Gather it into a ball and rub it with oil (about 1/4 tsp).  Place it in a plastic bag and set it aside for at least 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Stuffing: </p>
        <p>Boil the potatoes in their skins and let them cool.  Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1/4 inch dices. Heat 4 tbsp oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat.  Fry onions until the edges are browned.  Add peas, ginger, green chili, cilantro, and 3 tbsp water. Lower heat and cover. Simmer until peas are cooked.  Stir to keep from sticking and add water if it becomes dry.</p>
        <p>Add potatoes, salt, coriander seeds, garam masala, cumin, cayenne and lemon juice.  Stir to mix.  Cook and stir for about 3 - 5 minutes.  Taste...  You may want to add more salt, lemon juice or cayenne.  Allow the mixture to cool.</p>

        <p class="bold">Putting it together: </p>
        <p>Knead dough again and divide it into eight balls of equal size.  Keep the balls of dough that are not being used covered with a damp towel.  Roll one of the balls out to about a 7 inch disk. Cut the disk in half. Form the half into a cone, sealing the seams with water.  Stuff the cone with about 2 - 2 1/2 tbsps of the stuffing.  Close the top of the cone by sticking the open edges together.  Use a fork or fingers to press the two seams firmly together.  Make 7 more using this method. Cover finished samosas with damp towel.
