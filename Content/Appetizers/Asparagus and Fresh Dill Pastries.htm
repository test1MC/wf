        <p>½ pound <MadCap:keyword term="Philo" />philo pastry (frozen)</p>
        <p>½ tsp canola oil</p>
        <p>1 lb <MadCap:keyword term="Asparagus" />asparagus spears (thin)</p>
        <p>½ medium <MadCap:keyword term="Bell Pepper" />red bell pepper</p>
        <p>1 tbsp unsalted <MadCap:keyword term="Butter" />butter (melted)</p>
        <p>1 tbsp <MadCap:keyword term="Olive oil" />olive oil</p>
        <p>4 oz soft <MadCap:keyword term="Chevre" />chevre</p>
        <p>¼ cup fresh <MadCap:keyword term="Dill" />dill springs (loosely packed)</p>
        <p>pepper (several grinds)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>Remove philo pastry from the freezer and allow to thaw in its packaging for about 4 hours before preparing the pastries.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Rub a cookie sheet or baking tin with the canola oil.  Rinse the asparagus and remove the tough part of the stalk.  You want the asparagus to be about 5 inches in length. Cut the bell pepper in half length wise and cut it into 8 thin strips. Mix the melted butter with the olive oil in a small bowl. Have a pastry brush on hand.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375°. Keep the dough that you are not working with covered at all times with a slightly damp tea towel so that it doesn't dry out.  Lay out one sheet of dough, brush it very lightly with the butter/oil mixture, lay another sheet on it, brush it with the mixture.  Proceed with this pattern until you have a stack of 5 sheets.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Starting at one of the short ends, place about a tablespoon of the soft chevre across the dough, but leave about 1 inch free on each side. Arrange one to two asparagus spears, a red bell pepper strip and several small sprigs of dill on top of the chevre. Grind a touch of pepper on it, fold over the free sides and roll up.  Moisten the edges with a little water to seal.  Place on the cookie sheet and prepare the 7 remaining rolls, keeping the prepared ones covered so that they do not dry out. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Bake for 35 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve hot.
