        <p>Preheat oven to 400</p>
        <p>Lightly oil 13 x 9 casserole</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finely chop green onions separating white from green parts </li>
            <li>Heat oil in skillet and add onions, garlic, white part of the green onions, salt and pepper and stir occasionally until onions release juices and start to brown.</li>
            <li>Add Soyrizo and brown</li>
            <li>Reduce heat and add potatoes, stir and cover.  Cook until potatoes are just tender.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a bowl to cool</li>
            <li> In separate bowl whisk eggs, sour cream, cheese and green part of green onions. Make sure to whip good to blend the sour cream completely and the egg batter is light and fluffy.  Salt and Pepper </li>

            <li>Sprinkle the soyrizo mixture over top of the egg mixture making sure it is evenly distributed.</li>

        <p> I found that making this a day ahead, completely cooled then storing in the fridge until the next day makes them a little easier to cut and serve as a finger food appetizer.  Serve at room temperature or warm in 325 oven.</p>
