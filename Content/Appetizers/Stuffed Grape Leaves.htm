        <p>2½ cups cooked <MadCap:keyword term="Quinoa" />Quinoa (cooked in vegetable broth)

</p>
        <p>1 cup sweet <MadCap:keyword term="Onion" />onion, minced

</p>
        <p>2 cloves <MadCap:keyword term="Garlic" />garlic, minced

</p>
        <p>1 - 2 stalks <MadCap:keyword term="Celery" />celery, minced

</p>
        <p>¼ cup<MadCap:keyword term="sunflower seeds" /> sunflower seeds

</p>
        <p>2 - 3 tbs olive oil

</p>
        <p>2 tbsp fresh <MadCap:keyword term="Mint" />mint, minced

</p>
        <p>Juice from one <MadCap:keyword term="Lemon" />lemon

</p>
        <p>¼ cup fresh <MadCap:keyword term="Parsley" />parsley, minced

</p>
        <p>1 cup <MadCap:keyword term="Ricotta cheese" />ricotta cheese 

</p>
        <p>Salt and pepper

</p>
        <p>About 40 <MadCap:keyword term="Grape leaves" />grape leaves (½ lb or 4.5 oz jar) </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>Cook quinoa and let cool a little (so you don't get burned)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Heat a saute pan and add oil.  When hot, saute the onion, garlic, celery and sunflower seeds until the onions are soft. Salt and pepper to taste.

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In a large bowl combine 2 1/2 cups of the cooked quinoa and all the ingredients from the saute pan.  Mix in parsley, mint, 1/2 of the lemon juice and ricotta cheese.  Taste and adjust accordingly with lemon juice, mint, quinoa, cheese, salt and pepper.

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Remove grape leaves from the jar, being careful not to tear them.  Rinse very well in cold water to remove the bitterness from the brine.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Place a leaf down flat, stem toward you, on a clean working surface.  Place a heaping tbsp (more or less) of the filling near the base of the leaf (stem) and roll tightly, folding in the sides.  Place on a lightly (olive) oiled cooking sheet.  Lightly spray or brush the tops with olive oil.  Bake 20 - 25 minutes, covered.  Uncover and bake another 5 minutes if they appear too moist.

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Let cool for 5 - 10 minutes before serving.  Serve with lemon wedges and sauce. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Quinoa can be replaced by brown rice.

</li>
            <li>If you use fresh grape leave, pick them around June or they will be too tough.

</li>
            <li>This can be served as a main dish over a bed of rice pilaf and a salad.

</li>
            <li>Reese grape leaves are the best that we've found.
</li>
        </ul>
