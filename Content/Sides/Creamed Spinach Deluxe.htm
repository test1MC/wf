        <p>Bring ¼ cup water to boil in large pot. Add half of spinach to pot; toss  until wilted but still bright green, about 3 minutes. Add remaining spinach and  toss until just wilted. Transfer spinach to strainer set over large bowl. Press  on spinach to release all liquid. Transfer spinach to work surface; coarsely  chop. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, bay leaf,  dried chile, and peppercorns; sauté until onion is soft but not brown, about 3  minutes. Whisk in flour and salt. Cook until mixture is pale gold and has nutty  aroma, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk. Boil until  thick, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes. Strain béchamel sauce into medium  bowl. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Heat cream in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat until just simmering.  Add béchamel; whisk until mixture is smooth and begins to simmer. Add spinach  and stir until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper. </p>

        <p>It is important to remove as much water from the spinach as possible so what I have done, as suggested by another epicurious reader, is to roll the spinach in a clean bath towel and press it out. Worked well for me.</p>
