        <p class="from">Recipe courtesy of Bon Appétit, 2010</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Ingredients.flsnp">
        </MadCap:snippetBlock>
        <p>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups chopped onion</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper</p>
        <p>Coarse kosher salt</p>
        <p>1 8- to 10-ounce package frozen artichoke hearts, thawed, drained</p>
        <p>2 garlic cloves, minced</p>
        <p>1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes in juice (preferably fire-roasted)</p>
        <p>8 ounces red-skinned or white-skinned potatoes, peeled, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons drained capers</p>
        <p>8 large eggs</p>

        <p>Heat olive oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion, chopped thyme, and crushed red pepper; sprinkle lightly with coarse kosher salt and sauté until onion is tender and golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add artichokes and minced garlic; stir 1 minute. Stir in diced tomatoes with juice and bring to boil. Reduce heat; cover skillet and simmer 15 minutes to allow flavors to blend.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, cook potatoes in small saucepan of boiling salted water just until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Add potatoes and capers to tomato-artichoke sauce; cover and simmer 5 minutes. Season to taste with coarse salt and pepper. DO AHEAD: Tomato-artichoke sauce can be made up to 6 hours ahead. Cool slightly, then cover and refrigerate. Rewarm sauce before continuing.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Preheat oven to 375°F. Pour tomato-artichoke sauce into 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Using back of spoon, make 8 evenly spaced indentations in sauce for holding eggs. Crack 1 egg into each indentation in sauce (some of eggs may run together slightly in spots). Bake until egg whites and yolks are softly set, 12 to 16 minutes. Carefully remove baking dish from oven; sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over and serve.</p>
