        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 

 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Sauce: 

</p>
        <p>In a medium saucepan, over medium heat, melt the butter. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes. Whisk in 1 cup of the milk stirring constantly.  When warm repeat until all the milk has been added. Season with salt, pepper, tarragon and nutmeg. Stir in 1/2 cup of the parmigiano reggiano cheese. Cook, stirring constantly for 4 to 6 minutes until it reaches a soupy consistency and the taste is as desired. Remove from the heat and stir in the spinach. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Filling: 

</p>
        <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, garlic and Mozzarella cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well. 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Season the lobster with salt and pepper. (optional: squeeze a little fresh lemon juice over the lobster). 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Lasagna: </p>
        <p>You can use a greased 8x8x2 inch square pan or 4 single serving 2-inch deep ramekins or baking dishes.  We prefer using the baking dishes or ramekins. (The assembly directions are for the 8x8 square pan, follow the same steps but smaller proportions for the ramekins). Spread about 1 cup of the sauce over the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle 1/4 of the lobster over the sauce. Sprinkle some of the remaining Parmesan cheese over the lobster. Cover the cheese with the fresh pasta. Spread 1/4 of the filling evenly over the pasta. Repeat the layering until all of the ingredients are used. Top the lasagna with the remaining sauce. Place in the oven and bake until bubbly and golden, about 45 minutes. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes. Garnish and serve.

        <p>This recipe was inspired on our trip to the Dominican Republic. We ate a  nice restaurant over the Ocean and had several different seafood dishes. When I got back to the States I had to try to recreate this dish.
