        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Ingredients.flsnp" />
        <p>3 medium-sized eggplants</p>
        <p>6 eggs, beaten</p>
        <p>4 cups fine Italian bread crumbs, seasoned (Progresso works fine)</p>
        <p>Olive oil, for frying</p>
        <p>8 cups <MadCap:xref href="Marinara Sauce.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Marinara Sauce (Salsa al pomodoro)<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"> (page 1)</MadCap:conditionalText></MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>2 cups grated Romano cheese</p>
        <p>1½ pounds Mozzarella cheese, shredded</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>Make the Marinara Sauce  before preparing the egg plant and keep warm (serving temperature).

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Wash the eggplants and slice into ¼ inch thick slices. Place eggplant slices on layers of paper towels and sprinkle with a little salt.  Cover them with another layer of paper towels and hold it down with something heavy (Cookbooks, Casserole dish, etc). This is to drain the acidic moisture from the eggplant.  Let sit for about one hour.

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In a non-stick or cast iron skillet, heat enough oil to fry the eggplant pieces (or you can bake the eggplant on a baking sheet).  Dip each eggplant slice in the beaten eggs, then coat it well with the bread crumbs.   Fry on both sides until golden brown. Drain and cool eggplant on layers of paper towels. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are several ways to prepare this dish:
</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>After draining the oil from the eggplant for a minute or two place three pieces on a plate, put some Mozzarella cheese on them, Pour some Marinara Sauce over them and top with a little more Mozzarella and Romano cheeses. 
</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°. Spread enough Marinara Sauce on the bottom of the baking dish to coat it. Top with a layer of eggplant slices. Top eggplant with some Mozzarella cheese. Add Marinara Sauce on top of that.  Finally top the sauce with Mozzarella and Romano cheese. Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until the Mozzarella cheese on top is melted. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°. Spread enough Marinara Sauce on the bottom of the baking dish to coat it. Top with a layer of eggplant slices. Cover those with a layer of Mozzarella and Romano, then more of the sauce.  Repeat, starting with a layer of eggplant, until you fill the baking dish about 1/8 inch from the top (Usually about 2 to 4 layers).
Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until the Mozzarella cheese on top is melted.  Let the dish settle for about 10 minutes before serving, so that when you are cutting the casserole into pieces it will not be too runny. 
</li>
        </ol>
