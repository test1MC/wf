        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Ingredients.flsnp" />
        <p>2½ - 3 tbsp minced garlic

</p>
        <p>3 tbsp olive oil

</p>
        <p>5½ lbs. ripe plum tomatoes

</p>
        <p>1 cup dry red wine

</p>
        <p>1 tbsp. oregano

</p>
        <p>1 tbsp basil

</p>
        <p>1 tsp. thyme

</p>
        <p>1 pinch rosemary

</p>
        <p>Salt and pepper to taste

        <p>In a large pot, steam the tomatoes until soft. Place them in a plastic or glass bowl or casserole dish do cool. Remove the skins and squash the tomatoes through a colander or food mill, removing the hard stem ends (if you use canned tomatoes, do not steam them beforehand). Put the tomatoes and their juice, and red wine into the pot with the garlic. Add the oregano, basil, thyme and rosemary.  Season with salt and pepper. 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Lightly sauté the garlic in the olive oil in a large pot for a few minutes.  Be careful not to brown the garlic.  Remove the pot from heat.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Bring the sauce to a boil and then turn the heat down low. Cover tightly and simmer for an hour or two, stirring regularly. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the tomatoes are not juicy, and depending on how long you cook your sauce, you can add a little water. </li>
            <li>If the sauce is too watery, simmer uncovered until the desired consistency is achieved. </li>
            <li>You want your sauce a little thinner than a meat sauce but not too watery either. 
</li>
        </ul>
