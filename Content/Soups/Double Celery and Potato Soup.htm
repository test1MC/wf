        <p>Melt butter with oil in heavy large pot over medium heat. Add leeks and onion and sauté until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in potatoes, celery roots, thyme, and bay leaf. Add broth and bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 40 minutes. Add celery stalks and simmer until all vegetables are very tender, about 12 minutes longer. Cool slightly. 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Using handheld blender, puree soup in pot. Stir cream into soup. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 

 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Ladle soup into bowls and garnish with reserved celery leaves and serve.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Suggestions.flsnp" />
        <p>Using a handheld blender to puree the soup right in the pot makes it easier to prepare. If the celery root is stringy, press the soup through a strainer.

 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This is supposed to be a mild soup but if the vegetable broth is too weak, use a some vegetable bullion cubes to add a little flavor. 

 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Try adding mushrooms

 

If desired spinach leaves can be added about 5 - 10 minutes before serving but after blending.
</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If celery root isn't available, use 3X - 4X the celery.
</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and chill celery leaves. Cool soup slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Rewarm soup over medium heat before serving.
