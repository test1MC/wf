        <p>6 cups chicken, beef, or vegetable stock or water</p>
        <p>Freshly ground black pepper</p>

        <p>Heat the oil in a large, deep pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about a minute or two. Add the carrot and celery and keep cooking and stirring until brightly colored, about 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Add the lentils, bay leaf, and stock, chipotle flakes; sprinkle with freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Add more stock if the soup is too thick. Just before serving, taste, sprinkle with salt and more pepper if needed, and serve.</p>

        <p>This is a very versatile soup. I have replaced the carrots with orange peppers before, added smoked (veggie) sausage, added potatoes, etc. </p>
