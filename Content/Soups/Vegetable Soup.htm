        <p>Add a good amount of butter to a stock pot until melted.  Add onions and all of the celery and slowly cook for about 5 minutes.  Add the carrots and leek and cook for another 5 minutes. Fill pot with just enough water to cover the vegetables, add the tomatoes with juices and turn up the heat until it starts to boil.  Add other vegetables and cover with vegetable broth by about 1 inch.  Cover, heat until it boils, then reduce the heat and simmer until the new vegetables are done.

        <p>This soup was made one fall day a couple of years ago and has not been made the same since. We always experiment with the vegetables used amounts of each and always end up making way too much.  You will have leftovers, but it can be frozen for a later time.
