        <p class="bold">Rice: 

</p>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion and next 4 ingredients and sauté until onion softens, about 4 minutes. Add broth and lentils; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, 10 minutes. Stir in rice; return to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice and lentils are tender, about 15 minutes longer. 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Blackened Onions: 

</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sliced onions and sauté until soft and beginning to blacken, about 20 minutes. 

 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Season rice and lentils to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to plates and  top with blackened onions. Place tomatoes and cucumber on top or alongside. Top pilaf with dollop of yogurt. Sprinkle with mint.

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Suggestions.flsnp" />
        <p>If using a really weak vegetable broth, you may want to add a vegetable bullion to add flavor.  </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The blackened onions really compliment the meal, and don't feel skittish about using the mint. It adds a very subtle tone that would be missed if left out. If you don't feel like this is enough food for an entire meal, maybe start with a smooth, creamy soup and flatbread.</p>
