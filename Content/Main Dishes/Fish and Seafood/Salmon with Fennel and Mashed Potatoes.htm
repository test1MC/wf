        <p><b>Salmon:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Stir fennel seeds in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 1½ minutes. Transfer seeds to small bowl and cool. Mix seeds together with butter, shallots, and 1 tablespoon fennel fronds. Season butter mixture with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Melt 1 tablespoon butter mixture in same large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add sliced fennel bulb and 1/4 cup water to skillet, cover and cook until fennel is crisp-tender, about 8 minutes. Uncover skillet and sauté until fennel begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer fennel to a bowl.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Wash salmon and sprinkle with salt and fresh pepper. Add 1 tablespoon butter mixture to same skillet and melt over medium heat. Add salmon skin side down, cover and cook 3 minutes. Turn salmon over, add ¼ cup water to skillet. Cover and continue cooking until salmon is just opaque in center, about 3 minutes longer. Slide salmon to 1 side of skillet and return fennel to skillet. Add 2 teaspoons butter mixture, and remaining 1 tablespoon chopped fennel fronds; stir to heat through being careful to not over cook the salmon.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Asparagus: </b>
        </p>
        <p>Place butter in a small skillet until hot (do not burn or brown). Add asparagus spears. Salt and pepper to taste and cook until done 3 - 4 minutes. Add a squeeze of lemon just before plating.</p>

        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Plating:</p>
        <p>Plate the Asparagus so that it looks like ½ of a spoked wheel, the 'buts' off center a little. Place a pile of fennel just to the top of the butts of asparagus. Place an equal sized pile of mashed potatoes next to the fennel. You should end up with one 'bed' of sides that covers the 'buts' of the asparagus (½ fennel, ½ potatoes). Place the salmon on the bed of sides. Garnish with an unchopped frond. drizzle any remaining butter from the asparagus pan over the asparagus and any remaining butter from the fennel pan over the salmon.</p>
