        <p>2 medium red bell peppers</p>
        <p>2 cups shredded escarole (or spinach)</p>
        <p>8 ounces mushrooms</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons garlic</p>
        <p>½ teaspoon chili powder</p>
        <p>2 teaspoon dried thyme</p>
        <p>½ cup walnuts</p>
        <p>½ cup soy/meat alternative crumbles</p>
        <p>½ cup fresh-grated Parmesan cheese</p>

        <p>Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut about 1 1/2 inches off the top of each pepper. Remove core, seeds, and ribs. In a 9-inch-square baking dish lined with aluminum foil invert the peppers and roast while you prepare the stuffing. They should be tender and slightly wrinkled. Remove the stems and thinly slice the mushrooms. Thinly shred the escarole and rinse to remove any dirt. Use a salad spinner or squeeze by hand to remove excess water. Toast the walnuts until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Process in a food processor until very finely ground and they start to cake. Set aside. In a skillet, heat oil on medium high and add garlic. Add thyme, chili powder, mushrooms, and soy/meat alternative crumbles. Saute for about 5-10 minutes just until the mushrooms start to release liquid. Add the escarole just until wilted, then remove from heat and mix in ground walnuts. Season to taste with salt and ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>Before stuffing peppers, sprinkle the inside with a couple pinches of salt and some olive oil. Stuff the peppers with the walnut stuffing and top with the grated cheese. Bake the peppers in the top of the oven for about 15 minutes or until the cheese melts.</p>
