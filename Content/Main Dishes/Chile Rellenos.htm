        <h2>Chile Rellenos</h2>
        <p class="from">Recipe courtesy of  Frank, 2010</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Ingredients.flsnp" />
        <p>6-12 large Poblano chiles, roasted, peeled and dried</p>
        <p>3-6 large eggs (approx. 1 egg for 2 chiles)</p>
        <p>¼ cup flour (optional)</p>
        <p>Block of Queso Blanco (or Monterey Jack), cut to fit inside the chilies</p>
        <p>Deep fryer or a large pan with 2 inches of oil</p>
        <p>Pinch of salt</p>
        <p>Paper towels for draining</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Sauce:</p>
        <p>Onions halved</p>
        <p>Tomatoes quartered</p>
        <p>Tomatillos, halved (optional)</p>
        <p>Anaheim chilies  (optional)</p>
        <p>Jalapeno or sorennto chilies  (optional)</p>
        <p>Salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p class="bold">Chilies:</p>
        <p>Roast and peel each chile and let them cool. Once cool enough to handle, insert a sharp knife into the top of the chile, and slice downward about half way down. Using a spoon or a knife, scrape the seeds and membrane out, without tearing the flesh. Insert a slice of cheese into the chilie, being careful not to tear it. Trim down the cheese as needed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>(optional) If your chilies are wet this step will help the batter stick to them. Place half of the flour on the bottom of a plate. Place the chiles on the flour and sprinkle the rest of the flour on top. Use your finger to make sure the entire chile is coated. Dust off remaining flour and set chiles aside.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Sauce:</p>
        <p>Prepare the vegetables and pace them on a cookie sheet drizzle then with olive oil, salt and pepper. Broil them until roasted and slightly charred.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Slice the onion and put it in a pan. Cook on medium heat until it starts to brown. Add the remaining of the vegetables to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Strain the puree (optional) and add it to the onions. Cook until hot or reduced to the desired consistency. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Batter:</p>
        <p>Whip 3-6 egg whites until stiff. Slowly fold in yolks and a pinch of salt and any herbs you may want. We use a touch or oregano sometimes. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Heat the oil until a drop of batter will 'cook' in it. One at a time, dip the chiles into the batter and then into the hot oil. Cook until batter is a crisp golden brown, flipping as needed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Remove chiles from the oil and drain on paper towels.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Serve with a Sauce and <MadCap:xref href="../Sides/Mexican Rice.htm">Mexican Rice (see page 1)</MadCap:xref></p>

        <p> You can use other chiles for this recipe, Anaheim, New Mexico, etc. The smaller the chilie, the harder it is to peel and stuff.</p>
        <p>Use cold eggs for the batter.</p>
        <p>If you use flour it should be a very light coat. It helps the batter stick to the chile.</p>
