        <p>Grill or pan fry "chicken" strips &amp; chop into small pieces, set aside.  Chop chilies and garlic together and set a side.  Mix soup and 2 cans of milk into a deep sauce pan and warm over medium heat until warm. Stirring often to avoid sticking.  Add chile and chicken. Stirring often to avoid sticking.  Add more soup if it needs thickened.  Bring to boil and simmer for 5 - 10 minutes (to meld flavors).  Salt and pepper to taste.

        <p>Dip corn tortillas one at a time and make a layer of them on the bottom of a 13x9x2 casserole dish. Make sure to bring some sauce with each one. Each layer will be about five tortillas.  Add cheese and onion between each layer.  repeat until almost all the sauce is gone (about three layers).  Top the casserole off with remaining sauce, cheese and onion.

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Bake at 350 for 20 - 30 minutes (until top is golden).  Let cool for 10 - 15 minutes before serving.

        <p>If the sauce isn't quite right, you can use bullion or other flavorings to bring out a little more flavor. We try to use Campbell's Soup for this recipe. other soups are good but require the recipe to be tweaked more. Not like we've make this recipe the same twice though. </p>
