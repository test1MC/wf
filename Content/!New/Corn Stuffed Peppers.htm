        <h2>Corn Stuffed Peppers</h2>
        <p class="from">Recipe courtesy of Eric Bearden, 2004&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Ingredients.flsnp" />
        <p>6 sweet bell peppers, red, yellow, orange, or a combination</p>
        <p>2 T butter</p>
        <p>½ cup minced celery</p>
        <p>½ cup minced onions</p>
        <p>4 ears of fresh corn, kernels cut off the cob</p>
        <p>½ to 1 whole diced jalapeno depending on preference of heat</p>
        <p>minced garlic, several cloves</p>
        <p>3 eggs, slightly beaten</p>
        <p>salt and pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1½ cups of bread crumbs</p>
        <p>1½ cups of cheese-</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>Swiss is actually good, but cheddar, mozzarella, 
 or pepper jack would be good choices too. &#160;A 
 combo of a few different kinds works well. &#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Optional: &#160;3 
 medium tomatoes, minced and seeded. &#160;Or 
 chicken broth or vegetable broth would be good to keep the stuffing moist. 
 &#160;I would 
 pour the broth over the peppers about halfway through the baking process. 
 &#160;Could add 
 black beans and rice for heartier peppers, or serve this on the side. 
 &#160;I think 
 diced green chilies would be good to add as well. &#160;Finally, 
 some type of seeds would be a good addition too- sunflower, or pinons. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Slice the tops off the peppers. &#160;Use 
 peppers that will stand upright in a casserole dish. &#160;Rub 
 oil on the peppers inside and out, and then blanch in boiling water for 
 5 minutes. &#160;Then 
 cool them down to stop the cooking process and place in a casserole dish 
 with ½ inch of water. &#160;Save 
 the tops of the peppers as well.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Saute the onion, garlic, and celery in the butter until translucent. 
 &#160;In a large 
 bowl add the onion, celery, and garlic to the corn and &#160;jalapeno. 
 &#160;Toss in 
 the breadcrumbs and salt and pepper. &#160;Add 
 the eggs and mix well. &#160;(Optional: 
 &#160;This is 
 a good time to add the rice and black beans if you want.) &#160;Add 
 some of the cheese into the mixture but save some for the tops of the 
 peppers later. &#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Stuff the peppers- mounding the tops. &#160;Cover 
 with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour, the last 10 minutes take 
 the foil off and add the cheese to the tops of the peppers and replace 
 the lids. &#160;</p>
