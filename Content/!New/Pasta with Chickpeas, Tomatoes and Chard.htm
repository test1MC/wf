        <h2>Pasta with Chickpeas, Tomatoes and Chard</h2>
        <p class="from">Recipe courtesy of &#160;Vegetarian Times, September 1999</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Ingredients.flsnp" />
        <p>8 oz dried penne or rotelle pasta
</p>
        <p>2 tbsp olive oil
</p>
        <p>1 medium onion, chopped
</p>
        <p>3 medium cloves garlic, minced
</p>
        <p>2 pinches red pepper flakes
</p>
        <p>2 tsp chopped fresh thyme or ½ tsp dried
</p>
        <p>1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary or ½ tsp dried
</p>
        <p>½ tsp paprika
</p>
        <p>Pinch saffron threads (optional)
</p>
        <p>15-oz can chickpeas, drained, ½ cup liquid reserved
</p>
        <p>2 (14 to 16 oz) cans tomatoes, drained
</p>
        <p>1 large bunch Swiss chard (1½ lbs), stemmed and rinsed well
</p>
        <p>½ cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese
</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta; stir to prevent sticking. Cook pasta until just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain well and set aside. </p>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350°F. </p>
        <p>Lightly grease 2-quart casserole.

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, pepper, thyme, rosemary, paprika and saffron if desired. Cook, stirring often, until onion is tender, 8 minutes. 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Add chickpeas, reserved liquid and tomatoes to onion mixture. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, breaking up tomatoes with spoon. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes. If mixture becomes dry, add a little water to keep it moist.
</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in large saucepan fitted with steamer basket, bring 2 inches water to a boil over high heat. Add chard, cover and steam until bright green and tender, about 3 minutes. Remove chard and coarsely chop. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Transfer to large bowl and stir in 2 teaspoons oil and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in pasta, chickpea mixture and Parmesan.

Transfer pasta mixture to prepared casserole. Drizzle with remaining 1 teaspoon oil and season with pepper. Cover with foil and bake until hot, about 20 minutes.
