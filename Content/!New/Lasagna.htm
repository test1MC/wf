        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>8 ounces whole-wheat lasagna noodles</p>
        <p>1 pound lean spicy Italian turkey sausage, casings removed (see Variation)</p>
        <p>4 cups sliced mushrooms (10 ounces)</p>
        <p>1/4 cup water</p>
        <p>1 pound frozen spinach, thawed</p>
        <p>1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes, preferably chunky</p>
        <p>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>Freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1 pound part-skim ricotta cheese (2 cups)</p>
        <p>8 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 2 cups), divided</p>
        <p>directions</p>
        <p>1.Preheat oven to 350°F. Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</p>
        <p>2.Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook until not quite tender, about 2 minutes less than the package directions. Drain; return the noodles to the pot, cover with cool water and set aside.</p>
        <p>3.Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook, crumbling with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 4 minutes. Add mushrooms and water; cook, stirring occasionally and crumbling the sausage more, until it is cooked through, the water has evaporated and the mushrooms are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Squeeze spinach to remove excess water, then stir into the pan; remove from heat.</p>
        <p>4.Mix tomatoes with basil, salt and pepper in a medium bowl.</p>
        <p>5.To assemble lasagna: Spread 1/2 cup of the tomatoes in the prepared baking dish. Arrange a layer of noodles on top, trimming to fit if necessary. Evenly dollop half the ricotta over the noodles. Top with half the sausage mixture, one-third of the remaining tomatoes and one-third of the mozzarella. Continue with another layer of noodles, the remaining ricotta, the remaining sausage, half the remaining tomatoes and half the remaining mozzarella. Top with a third layer of noodles and the remaining tomatoes.</p>
        <p>6.Cover the lasagna with foil and bake until bubbling and heated through, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. Remove the foil; sprinkle the remaining mozzarella on top. Return to the oven and bake until the cheese is just melted but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving. Vegetarian Variation: Use a sausage-style soy product, such as Gimme Lean, or simply omit the sausage altogether.</p>
        <p>7.Ingredient Note: Whole-wheat lasagna noodles are higher in fiber than white noodles. They can be found in health-food stores and some large supermarkets.</p>
