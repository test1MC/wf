</p>
        <p>¼ cup cilantro, torn into pieces

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p class="bold">Broth:</p>
        <p>Put stock, soy sauce, garlic, and onion in a large stockpot and bring to a boil over medium heat. 

 

</p>
        <p>Optional: Char ginger on all sides over an open gas flame or in a small skillet. 

 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Add the ginger, cinnamon sticks, lemon grass stalk, star anise, and bay leaves to the broth. Reduce the heat to low. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Simmer, partially covered, for 20-25 minutes. Adjust the taste as necessary while cooking.

 

Remove solids with a slotted spoon or strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve. Return to pot and keep hot until ready to use. 

 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="bold">Soup:</p>
        <p>When broth has been simmering for about 10 minutes, soak the noodles as follows. Bring 4 quarts of water to boil in a large pot. Remove from heat, add noodles, and let soak around 8- 15 minutes (depending on the thickness of the noodles), stirring occasionally until noodles are pliable and easily separated.

 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Drain the noodles and divide them among six bowls. Simmer the tofu in the broth until heated through, about 4 minutes. 

 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Add to noodles. Assemble the soup by placing the bean sprouts, cabbage, greens, basil, cilantro, scallions, and optional peanuts on top of the noodles and seitan. Ladle the hot broth onto the noodle mixture. 

 

</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Serve with a plate of lime wedges, chili rounds, and salt and pepper for individual seasoning.
