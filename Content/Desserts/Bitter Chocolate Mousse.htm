        <h2 class="new">Bitter Chocolate Mousse</h2>
        <p class="from">Recipe courtesy of  Hong Nguyen, 2010</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Ingredients.flsnp" />
        <p>8 oz <MadCap:keyword term="semisweet chocolate" />semisweet chocolate (I like to use at least 60% to 75% range)</p>
        <p>2 tbsp <MadCap:keyword term="brandy" />brandy or orange liqueur</p>
        <p>2 tbsp <MadCap:keyword term="unsalted butter" />unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</p>
        <p>4 <MadCap:keyword term="eggs" />eggs, separated white and yolks</p>
        <p>6 tbsp <MadCap:keyword term="whipping cream" />whipping cream</p>
        <p>3 tbsp <MadCap:keyword term="sugar" />sugar</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>Place the chocolate and 4 tbsp of water in a double boiler. Melt over a low heat, stirring until smooth. Turn off the heat once the chocolate is completely melted and whish in the liqueur and butter.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>With an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks until thick and creamy, then slowly beat into the melted chocolate until well blended. Set aside in the refrigerator. (I like to keep it cold between steps so the consistency is better at the end).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Whip the crème until soft peaks form and stir a spoonful into the chocolate to lighten it. Fold in the remaining crème.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In a clean, grease free bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until they are frothy. Gradually sprinkle over the sugar, while continuing to beat until the egg whites are stiff and very glossy.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Using a rubber spatula or large metal spoon, stir a quarter of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to slacken, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Spoon the mousse into cup dish. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours until set and chilled.</p>
