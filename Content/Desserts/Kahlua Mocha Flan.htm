        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Preparation.flsnp" />
        <p>In a heavy saucepan add ½ 
 cup water and 1 cup sugar. &#160;Stir 
 over medium heat stirring constantly, for 3 to 4 minutes or until dissolved. 
 Increase heat to medium-high; boil, without stirring, for about 15 minutes 
 or until caramel colored. Quickly pour into 8 individual four-ounce custard 
 cups (if syrup hardens, soften over low heat), evenly coating bottoms. 
 &#160;Set aside.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In a bowl dissolve chocolate in ¼ 
 cup hot milk/cream and set aside. &#160;In 
 blender or mixing bowl, combine eggs, milk or cream, remaining cup of 
 sugar, vanilla and salt. &#160;Process 
 for several seconds or whisk by hand until well blended. &#160;Add 
 dissolved chocolate mixture and ¼ 
 cup Kahlua and stir.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Pour mixture into custard cups and set then into a deep-sided baking 
 dish or pan. &#160;Fill 
 the outer container with water until it reaches 1 inch up the side of 
 the of the custard cups.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In preheated 350°F 
 oven bake 1 hour or until knife inserted into center of flan comes out 
 fairly clean. &#160;Remove 
 cups from water bath and allow to cool completely. &#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Suggestions.flsnp" />
        <p>Add a small amount of lemon juice or corn syrup to 
 the sugar and water mixture as soon as it begins to boil. &#160;This 
 will stop the sugar from crystallizing and ensure a nice caramel versus 
 a pan full of sugar crystals.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To unmold flan, run tip of wet knife along inside edge of cup. Place 
 serving dish up-side down over mold and quickly flip both the dish and 
 mold.&#160;</p>
